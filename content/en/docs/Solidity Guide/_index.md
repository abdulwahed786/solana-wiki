  A Solana development guide for developers with Ethereum and Solidity experience

## Welcome Solidity Developers

Solidity devs, it's time we've had a heart to heart or shall we say "Sol to SOL"
conversation about Solana development. First, this is not meant to convince
anyone that one blockchain is better than another, this isn't about maximalism.
This is about learning from each other and getting into the finer technical
details about how the two platforms are different. This guide aims to be a
resource for experienced Solidity developers who decide to build an application
on Solana.

## Does Solana support Solidity?

Not right now. Solidity was built to work really well for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM).  However, Solana's smart contract VM was designed with
fundamental differences from the EVM and so it currently does **not** support
Solidity. There are two ongoing efforts to support Solidity on Solana. Read more
[here](dev-environment/languages/#solidity).

## How can I do XXX on Solana?

You've come to the right place, this wiki is designed to answer everything a
Solidity developer would need to know about building on Solana. If the wiki
doesn't cover your question, please create an issue on the wiki Github. Thanks
for your contribution!
